## What is achari?
Achari is a nifty tool that you can use to convert Keep notes in a specified folder into the PDF format.The tool is mostly in the PoC stage and hence cannot yet convert all notes in the main Keep Note folder into PDF. Achari is also capable of converting Keep Notes into a single image in PNG format. 

### Installing dependencies
* sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev figlet

###Folder structure
In order to make use of Achari, your Keep Notes have to adhere to a strict folder structure. This is where all folders and subfolders **MUST** be preceded with a numerical value in ascending order.The images below, illustrate the supported folder structure.

##To do list
Achari is more of a PoC tool. I intend to work on the following features in due time: 
* Ability to customize PDF headers, font, etc. 
* Ability to create a cover page on the PDF
* Ability to create a table of contents for the PDF document
* Ability to convert multiple Keep Notes at a time
